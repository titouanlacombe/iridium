benchmark & optimize
simulation runner interface (run simulation with delta times) in the future will be his own thread
refactor emitters sub 1 rate
UI limit fps option
multithreaded particle update (custom foreach with stack size & thread pool)

Simulation events (time of execution, lambda taking simulation as argument) => store sorted list of events
Simulation builder object
emitter & consumer builder objects

add quadtree (readme.md)
add coulomb, friction, gravity

custom shading (geometry shader)

notes:
for sim benchmark disable render
