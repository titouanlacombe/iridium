improve handling of rand seed
improve handling of events handlers (taking more than just particles (hopefully also systems))
particles multithreaded iterator (hold thread pool & cluster size)

add particle color
more integrators option (euler, verlet, etc) & test smallest dt possible?
is it posible to implement particles lifetimes ?
create boids system as alternative from physic system
builders object to make simulation creation easier? look at good practices
iridium big facade?
create yaml config file?
benchmark & optimize

add quadtree (readme.md)
add coulomb, friction, gravity
benchmark & optimize

custom shading (geometry shader)
benchmark & optimize gpu?

notes:
for sim benchmark disable render
